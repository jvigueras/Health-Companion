## Inspiration
When illness strikes, it can feel as if life has come to a halt, presenting a barrage of decisions: to continue with daily activities or to pause, to prioritize health or privacy, and to seek immediate medical attention or not. Amidst this, questions arise: What is happening to me? How did I get here? What should I do next? How long will this condition last? Consulting a doctor is crucial, as we entrust them to address our concerns. However, it's essential to ask the right questions and effectively communicate our symptoms. Doctors are qualified professionals with experience, best practices, and current knowledge, aiming to perform with excellence. Yet, there is a risk of either over-treatment or under-diagnosis. Attention to detail by both parties can mitigate these risks, but the possibility of error remains.
## What it does
It assist reflecting on your symptoms. Health Companion may prepare your mind to be more aware and attentive, enabling your doctor to perform a more precise diagnosis. 
## How we built it
Google AI Studio allow us to model the prompt, selecting the model and tunning the settings.
Then we create a the app using Android Studio and GenerativeAI API for android. Finally, we perform some tests using google-generativeai API for python.
## Challenges we ran into
The Android library libs.generativeai did not allow system instructions and it required to upgrade to generativeai:0.4.0
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The idea coming to life. This could help to improve people's health and reduce the time doctors spend per patient.
## What we learned
1. GenerativeAI 1.5 surpassed my expectations and I had to apply some simplifications. 
2. The API itself has opportunities for flexibility.
## What's next for Health companion
This is one page in a thick book of problems where Health Companion may help.
